## Concept

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in data analysis and is often the first step performed by data scientists and analysts. This phase aims to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns, trends and anomalies, and formulate hypotheses that can guide more advanced analyses.

## Why do EDA?

**1. Data Understanding**:

- EDA allows for a deep understanding of the dataset, including the nature of variables, the distribution of values, and the relationships between different characteristics.

**2. Identification of Anomalies and Outliers**:

- Enables the detection of outliers and anomalies that can negatively affect subsequent analyses.

**3. Missing Data Treatment**:

- It helps in identifying missing data and formulating strategies to deal with these missing values.

**4. Missing Data Treatment**:

- It helps in identifying missing data and formulating strategies to deal with these missing values.

**5. Exploration of Trends and Patterns**:

- It facilitates the identification of temporal trends, seasonal patterns and correlations between variables, providing initial insights into the behavior of the data.

**6. Selection of Relevant Variables**:

- It helps in identifying relevant variables for further analysis, reducing the dimensionality of the data set.

**7. Validation of Initial Hypotheses**:

- It allows the validation of preliminary hypotheses and the generation of new questions that can be explored in more detailed analyses.

**8. Preparation for Statistical Modeling**:

- Provides essential information for choosing and adjusting statistical models or machine learning algorithms, improving modeling effectiveness.

**9. Data Visualization**:

- EDA often involves creating visualizations, such as graphs and histograms, that make it easier to communicate complex patterns to stakeholders and decision makers.

**10. Data Validation**:

- Helps ensure data quality by identifying inconsistencies, input errors, or coding issues.

## About Project

This repository contains Python code to perform an exploratory analysis of Netflix's top 10 daily shows. Analysis includes importing the dataset, exploring its characteristics, and gaining insights through statistical measures and visualizations.

I used the data from the dataset obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/netflix-daily-top-10-in-us?select=netflix+daily+top+10.csv.

Which used as a base the website The Numbers, responsible for obtaining the metrics daily: https://www.the-numbers.com/netflix-top-10.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10.9;
- Pandas library;
- Datetime library;
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode);
- Jupyter Notebook Extension for VSCode.

## How to Execute Project

To run the Python program, you need to have the Python environment installed on your system, as well as Jupyter Notebook. Once installed, follow the steps below:

**1. Clone the Repository**
   
- Make sure the `netflix_daily_top_10.csv` dataset is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook script.
  
**2. Run the Application.**
